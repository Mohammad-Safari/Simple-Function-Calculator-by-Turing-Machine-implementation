# Simple Function Calculator by Turing Machine implementation

## Functionality
this machine runs specifically on positive integers inputs like this

    3x + 5  ;   for x<20
    x mod 4 ;   for x>=20

but set of states for each operation and condition is reusable and configurable for more generalized and advanced machines as its runtime is not coupled to main flow of code and is separately implemented and states are generated dynamically during runtime

## Usage
run `python app.py <input_number>` in terminal
